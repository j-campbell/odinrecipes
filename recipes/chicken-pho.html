        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>With pho, it's really all about the broth. The noodles and bits of tender meat definitely have curb appeal and make the soup into a substantive meal, but all the real flavor and allure of pho comes from a slow-simmered broth.

        <p><strong>Cook time:</strong> cooking time</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Peel then slice the ginger into 4 or 5 coins. Smack with the flat side of a knife or meat mallet; set aside. Thinly slice the green parts of the green onion to yield 2 to 3 tablespoons; set aside for garnish. Cut the leftover sections into pinkie-finger lengths, bruise, then add to the ginger.<br>
          Coarsely chop the leafy tops of the cilantro to yield 2 tablespoons; set aside for garnish. Set the remaining cilantro sprigs aside.</li>
          <li>In a 3- to 4-quart (3 to 4 l) pot, toast the coriander seeds and clove over medium heat until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the ginger and green onion sections. Stir for about 30 seconds, until aromatic.</li>
          <li>Slide the pot off heat, wait 15 seconds or so to briefly cool, then pour in the broth.<br>
          Return the pot to the burner, then add the water, cilantro sprigs, chicken, and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then lower the heat to gently simmer.</li>
          <li>fter 5 to 10 minutes of simmering, the chicken should be firm and cooked through (press on it and it should slightly yield).</li>
          <li>Continue to simmer the broth without the chicken for another 15 to 20 minutes (for a total of 30 minutes simmering time).</li>
          <li>Transfer the chicken to a bowl, flush with cold water to arrest the cooking, then drain. Let cool, then cut or shred into bite-size pieces. Cover loosely to prevent drying.</li>
          <li>Soak the rice noodles in hot water until pliable and opaque. Drain, rinse, and set aside.</li>
          <li>When the broth is done, pour it through a fine-mesh strainer positioned over a 2-quart (2-liter) pot; line the strainer with muslin for superclear broth. Discard the solids. You should have about 4 cups. Season with fish sauce and sugar (or maple syrup), if needed, to create a strong savory-sweet note.</li>
          <li>Bring the strained broth to a boil over high heat. Put the noodles in a noodle strainer or mesh sieve and dunk in the hot broth to heat and soften, 5 to 60 seconds. Lift the noodles from the pot and divide between the 2 bowls.</li>
          <li>Lower the heat to keep the broth hot while you arrange the chicken on top of the noodles and garnish with the chopped green onion, cilantro, and a sprinkling of pepper. Taste and adjust the brothâ€™s saltiness one last time. Return the broth to a boil and ladle into the bowls. Enjoy with any extras, if you like.</li>
