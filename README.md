# Odin Recipes

My solution for the recipes project from the Odin Project Foundations Course. Students were asked to construct a recipes website with at least 3 recipes using HTML, CSS is optional and JS have not been covered yet.

Taken from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) free online course's [Project: Recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes). 

Started on June 12th, 2023.

Completed to the current state on the 12th June, 2023. As stated this was just intended as a HTML project and rather than spend a lot of time tweaking the CSS I've decided to move on to the next course module.

Repository is public as that is a requirement of marking.

This page is available on [github.io](https://j-campbell.github.io/odinrecipes/) as per The Odin Project requirements.
