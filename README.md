# Odin Recipes

My solution for the recipes project from the Odin Project Foundations Course. Students were asked to construct a recipes website with at least 3 recipes using HTML, CSS is optional and JS have not been covered yet.

Taken from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) free online course's [Project: Recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).
